
If the kill -9 PID command and the killall command are not working, it could indicate that the process is not able to be terminated due to certain circumstances or permissions. In such cases, you can try the following steps:
Use sudo to run the command with elevated privileges. For example:
bash
Copy code
sudo kill -9 PID
Try using the pkill command with the process name. For example:
Copy code
pkill -9 node
If none of the above options work, you can use the lsof command to get more information about the process and attempt to manually terminate it. First, identify the process ID (PID) and then use the kill command to terminate it. For example:
bash
Copy code
lsof -i :3000
kill -9 PID
Please note that using the kill -9 command with the SIGKILL signal should generally terminate the process forcefully. If it is still not working, there may be other factors involved, and it would be advisable to consult with a system administrator or seek further technical assistance.
